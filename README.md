Creating an interactive wall-mounted display that helps with the physical therapy
program and individual student goals at the Carter School in Boston, MA.  The system consists of puzzle piece-shaped panels with LED numbers that light up when students move past each panel's active IR sensor.  With this system, we will help to foster a desire in the students to achieve new milestones in their own mobility as well as a deeper understanding of cause-and-effect and number sense.
